Both Host and Clients need to run the run.py file. Host is shown their own ip, which they can share with the clients to allow them to connect. The host must portforward on ports internal 5001 -> external 5006; internal 5002 -> external 5007 to allow the clients to connect. The host can then set keys for the clients to use, and then the clients are able to use those keys when playing the game.
